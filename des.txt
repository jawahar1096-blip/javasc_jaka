The CSV creation in the gmail_flow workflow involves an "On demand trigger" initiating a process where task-1 fetches log data using a DQL query (e.g., fetch logs with filters for log.source == "uxl" and fields clientVersion, hostName, requestId from 05:09 PM to 05:11 PM IST on September 03, 2025). The email_script task processes this data, generates a CSV with the specified fields, encodes it in base64, and constructs a MIME email with the CSV as an attachment. The gmail_apirequest task then sends this base64-encoded email via the Gmail API using an access token stored in the Credential Vault, delivering the CSV to recipients like snehathamban24@gmail.com and jawahar1096@gmail.com.
